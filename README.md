quickquote
==========

An Insurance Quote app for the TAIGIR "Faster Tests, Faster Feedback" workshop.

Originally developed for the Sydney Testers bootcamp by Hans Dushanthakumar

**TODO: Update this readme to be more specific to running at IAG under windows**

####Things to have setup on your machine 
(just google them to find installers):

1. git
2. ruby 2.0.x
3. bundler gem
4. chrome

NOTE: The below three things can be downloaded for free from the internet, but you dont necessarily have to, as I have included the files in the "grid" folder.

5. Selenium Server standalone library
(*The latest version available appears to be 2.42.2. This version has a known issue with its http implementation. So, if you have no other compelling reason, try to use the version I provided in the "grid" folder, which has this issue fixed. This version is not released publicly yet*)

6. chromedriver*
(*If you do download this, copy it into any folder in your PATH and then make it executable.*)

7. phantomjs*
(*If you do download this, copy it into any folder in your PATH and then make it executable.*)


####To set up the project on your machine:
1. `git clone https://github.com/hdushan/quickquote.git`
2. `bundle install`

####Rake targets to run tests locally:
- `rake unit` *runs unit tests only*
- `rake chrome` *runs cucumber tests using chrome*
- `rake headless` *runs cucumber tests using phantomjs*
- `rake` *runs unit tests and cucumber tests headless*

####To run the app locally (The tests will automatically start the server app on your local machine, so you dont need to start it manually prior to running prior to test):
1. In the quickquote folder, run '`shotgun`'
2. Use a browser to navigate to 
http://localhost:9393

####Rake targets to run tests against the heroku-hosted app:
- `rake qa_chrome` *runs cucumber tests using chrome*
- `rake qa_headless` *runs cucumber tests using phantomjs*

####Selenium Grid:
######To start hub
In folder quickquote/grid:
- `java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.42.2x.jar -role hub`

######To start node (Chrome/OSX)
In folder quickquote/grid:
- `java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.42.2x.jar -role node -nodeConfig osxchrome.json -port 5556`
ps: change the "port" number as required for each node. Each node on the same machine needs a unique port number.

######To start node (Chrome/Win7)
In folder quickquote\grid:
- `java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.42.2x.jar -role node -nodeConfig win7chrome.json -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=Y:\Workspace\quickquote\grid\chromedriver.exe`

####Rake targets to run tests parallely against local app (The tests will automatically start the server on your local machine, so you dont need to start it manually prior to running prior to test):
(NOTE: Please have at least 3 nodes running, all on the same machine as the server):
- `rake chromeparallel` *runs cucumber tests parallely using chrome*
- `rake headlessparallel` *runs cucumber tests parallely using phantomjs*
